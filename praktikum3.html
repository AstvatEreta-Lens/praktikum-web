        <h1>Polar Bear</h1>
        <p>The polar bear (Ursus maritimus) is a large bear native to the Arctic and surrounding areas. It is closely
            related to the brown bear, and the two species can interbreed. The polar bear is the largest extant species
            of bear and land carnivore, with adult males weighing 300–800 kg (700–1,800 lb). The species is sexually
            dimorphic, as adult females are much smaller. The polar bear is white- or yellowish-furred with black skin
            and a thick layer of fat. It is more slender than the brown bear, with a narrower skull, longer neck and
            lower shoulder hump. Its teeth are sharper and more adapted to cutting meat. The paws are large and allow
            the bear to walk on ice and paddle in the water.</p>
        <p>Carl Linnaeus classified the polar bear as a type of brown bear (Ursus arctos), labelling it as Ursus
            maritimus albus-major, articus in the 1758 edition of his work Systema Naturae.[8] Constantine John Phipps
            formally described the polar bear as a distinct species, Ursus maritimus in 1774, following his 1773 voyage
            towards the North Pole.[4][9] Due to its adaptations to a marine environment, some taxonomists like Theodore
            Knottnerus-Meyer have placed the polar bear in its genus Thalarctos.[10][11] However Ursus is widely
            considered to be the valid genus for the species based on the fossil record and the fact that it can breed
            with the brown bear.[11][12]

            Different subspecies have been proposed including Ursus maritimus maritimus and U. m. marinus.[a][13]
            However these are not supported and the polar bear is considered to be monotypic.[14] One possible fossil
            subspecies, U. m. tyrannus, was posited in 1964 by Björn Kurtén, who reconstructed the subspecies from a
            single fragment of an ulna which was approximately 20 percent larger than expected for a polar bear.[12]
            However, re-evaluation in the 21st century has indicated that the fragment likely comes from a giant brown
            bear</p>
